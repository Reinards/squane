			<h2>Instructions</h2>

			<div class="line"></div>
			
			<p>Main goal: While keeping score higher or equal to 0, get as high level as you can. You get a score for every correctly guessed square, but you lose few for every missed square. The more score you have, the more you lose per miss. </p>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<p>For a moment you can see colorful squares. Your task - remember it! Under the game table you will see an icon of some square. You have to tap those grey squares, which previously had color of the icon. When you check all of them (probably none, if there were none of that color) tap the icon under the game table. It will show another color. You will have to do the same thing. When you check all of the squares, new level will start. Remember to check ALL squares of one color because one color icon will be shown just once a level!</p>
